This lab is intended to practice concepts concerning efficiency and

(* We open `CS51Utils` to provide access to the `Absbook` module, and
   timing functions such as `Absbook.call_timed`. You installed the
   `CS51Utils` package at the beginning of the course. You'll find the
   `Absbook` module source code in the file `absbook.ml` in the CS51

Part 1: Empirical analysis of functions

In the reading, we empirically determined the efficiency of mergesort
and insertion sort by timing these functions on the same inputs of
various lengths. The ability to perform empirical analysis of programs
will often prove useful.

    Throughout this lab you may find various functions in the
    `Absbook` module to be helpful, as well as OCaml's `Random`
    library module
    <https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Random.html>.

    In order to make use of the `Absbook` module from within `ocaml`
    or `utop`, you may need to inform these REPLs of information about
    the module's location. If you have trouble accessing `Absbook`
    functions, try the commands in the following example:

        % ocaml
                OCaml version 4.11.1

        # #use "topfind" ;;
        ...
        - : unit = ()
        # #require "CS51Utils" ;;
        ...
        # open CS51Utils ;;
        # Absbook.call_timed ;;
        - : ?count:int -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b * float = <fun>

Exercise 1: Write a function `random_list` that creates a list of a
specified length of random integers between 0 and 999 inclusive. Hint:
You may find the `List.init` function to be helpful.
....................................................................*)

let random_list (length : int) : int list =
  List.init length (fun _ -> Random.int 1000) ;;

(*....................................................................
Exercise 2: Write a function `time_sort` that, given an `int list ->
int list` sorting function and a list of integers, returns a `float`
indicating how long in milliseconds that the sort takes. Hint: You may
find the `Absbook.call_timed` function to be helpful.

let time_sort (sort : int list -> int list) (lst : int list) : float =
  snd (Absbook.call_timed sort lst) ;;

       order by OCaml's `<` operator. *)
    val sort : 'a list -> 'a list

module InsertSort : SORT =

    let rec insert (xs : 'a list) (x : 'a) : 'a list =

                    else hd :: (insert tl x) ;;

module MergeSort : SORT =

    let rec split (xs : 'a list) : 'a list * 'a list =
      match xs with
      | [] -> [], []
      | [x] -> [x], []
      | first :: second :: rest -> let rest1, rest2 = split rest in
                                   first :: rest1, second :: rest2
        
    let rec merge (xs : 'a list) (ys : 'a list) : 'a list = 
      match xs, ys with 
      | [], _ -> ys
      | _, [] -> xs
      | x :: xs_tl, y :: ys_tl -> 
         if x < y then x :: (merge xs_tl ys)
         else y :: (merge xs ys_tl) 
      
    let rec sort (xs : 'a list) : 'a list = 
      match xs with 
      | []
      | _ :: [] -> xs
      | _ -> let first, second = split xs in
             merge (sort first) (sort second) 
  end ;;

Exercise 3: How many functions does the `InsertionSort` module
provide? How many functions does the `MergeSort` module
provide? Define the variables below accordingly (replacing the `-1`
values).
....................................................................*)

(* Both modules provide a function

       sort : ('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list
   
   and *no other functions*, as specified by the SORT signature. In
   particular, the functions `insert`, `split`, and `merge` are not
   accessible outside the module. *)

let insertion_sort_provides : int = 1 ;;
let merge_sort_provides : int = 1 ;;

(*....................................................................
Exercise 4: Compare the time it takes for merge sort and insertion
sort to run on lists of random ints of length 10 and 1000. Use the
implementation of merge and insertion sort above.
....................................................................*)
  
(* A first attempt to fill in the table may have included running the
   following code:

     time_sort InsertSort.sort (random_list 10) ;;
     time_sort InsertSort.sort (random_list 1000) ;;
     time_sort MergeSort.sort  (random_list 10) ;;
     time_sort MergeSort.sort  (random_list 1000) ;;

   However, this method of comparing the functions will not be
   entirely accurate: merge sort and insertion sort are running on
   different input lists. Though the lists are the same length, they
   may be unsorted to a different degree. Just as when conducting
   scientific experiments in a laboratory, we need to keep everything
   but our subject of interest (in this case the sorting function)
   constant to create a fair comparison.

   Thus, our method of filling in the table looked as below:

     let shortlist : int list = random_list 10 ;;
     let longlist : int list = random_list 1000 ;;

     time_sort InsertSort.sort shortlist ;;
     time_sort InsertSort.sort longlist ;;
     time_sort MergeSort.sort  shortlist ;;
     time_sort MergeSort.sort  longlist ;;

   Using this method, we generated the following times:

                   |    List length 10    |  List length 1000
                   |    Time (msecs)      |  Time (msecs)
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Insertion Sort  |    0.00286           |    7.853
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Merge Sort      |    0.00691           |    1.002
   ------------------------------------------------------------

   In summary, merge sort is a little slower on the short list but
   much faster on the long list, consistent with its better
   asymptotic complexity. (You're numbers may vary of course.)

   Generally when running experiments, it is good practice to run
   more than one trial. We can do this for our timing as well to
   increase our confidence in the time each algorithm takes. We may
   start by writing a function that runs a number of trials and
   averages the time of the result.

   let run_sort_trials (num : int)
                       (timer : (int list -> int list) -> int list -> float)
                       (sort : (int list -> int list))
                       (input : int list)
                     : float =
       let average (lst : float list) =
         (List.fold_left ( +. ) 0. lst) 
         /. float_of_int (List.length lst) in
       List.init num (fun _ -> timer sort input)
       |> average ;;

   We can then find the average of 50 trials for each list length.

   run_sort_trials 50 time_sort InsertSort.sort shortlist ;;
   run_sort_trials 50 time_sort InsertSort.sort longlist ;;
   run_sort_trials 50 time_sort MergeSort.sort  shortlist ;;
   run_sort_trials 50 time_sort MergeSort.sort  longlist ;;

                   |    50 Trial Average  |  50 Trial Average
                   |    List length 10    |  List length 1000
                   |    Time (msecs)      |  Time (msecs)
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Insertion Sort  |    0.00134           |   7.2716
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Merge Sort      |    0.00373           |   1.1035
   ------------------------------------------------------------

   The numbers we report below are all based on averaging 50 trials,
   as here.

Part 2: Big-O

......................................................................
Exercise 5: In the reading for this lab, we saw that big-O notation is
a generic way of expressing the growth rate of a function. For each of
the functions defined below, state in which big-O class(es) the
function belongs.

To allow us to check answers, we've defined an OCaml data type,
`complexity`, with various commonly used big-O classes. The
name-to-function mapping is set out below. We will use informal
function notation in this lab. For more on informal versus formal
notation, please refer to the reading for today's lab.

    Constant    -> O(1)
    Logarithmic -> O(log(n))
    Linear      -> O(n)
    LogLinear   -> O(n log(n))
    Quadratic   -> O(n^2)
    Cubic       -> O(n^3)
    Exponential -> O(2^n)

Because functions can be in more than one complexity class, the format
of the solution to each exercise is a list of complexity classes. By
way of example, we've done the first problem (Exercise 5a) for you.
....................................................................*)

type complexity =
    | Constant
    | Logarithmic
    | Linear
    | LogLinear
    | Quadratic
    | Cubic
    | Exponential ;;

(* f(x) = 5^x + x^3 *)
let exercise5a () : complexity list =
  [Exponential] ;;

(* f(x) = 0 *)
let exercise5b () : complexity list =
  [Constant; Logarithmic; Linear; LogLinear; Quadratic; Cubic; Exponential] ;;
  
(* f(x) = 3 x^2 + 2 x + 4  *)
let exercise5c () : complexity list =
  [Quadratic; Cubic; Exponential] ;;

(* f(x) = (2 x - 3) log(x) + 100 x *)
let exercise5d () : complexity list =
  [LogLinear; Quadratic; Cubic; Exponential] ;;

(* f(x) = x (x^2 + x) *)
let exercise5e () : complexity list =
  [Cubic; Exponential] ;;

(* Note: Often, we are most interested in the tightest big-O class a
   function belongs to. When discussing functions such as f(x) = x^2,
   you may hear someone say f is O(x^2). However, for f to be O(g), f
   simply grows as slow or slower than g. Thus, we could also say that
   for f(x) = x^2, f is O(2^x).  We will be explicit regarding
   situations in which we would like you to determine a tight big-O
   bound (that is, the slowest growing function class that f is a part
   of) or a generic big-O bound (any function class f is a part of, as
   we asked for in this problem). *)
  
(* One advantage of big-O is that we can disregard constants in
considering asymptotic performance of functions. We saw empirically
that on large inputs, merge sort worked faster than insertion
sort. The ability to disregard constants tells us that merge sort will
eventually be faster than insertion sort, even if we add a constant
amount of time to merge sort's performance. 

Let's actually do this and test the results empirically!

Here is a version of merge sort that inserts a small constant delay
(50 milliseconds), to simulate a version of the function with the same
asymptotic complexity but that is a constant amount slower. *)

module DelayMergeSort : SORT =
  struct
    (* DelayMergeSort first sleeps for a predetermined period of time,
       then runs our generic MergeSort sort.  This sleep will add a
       constant amount of time to each run of DelayMergeSort.  *)
    let sort (xs : 'a list) : 'a list =
      let () = Unix.sleepf 0.05 in
      MergeSort.sort xs  ;;

(* You likely found that InsertSort was faster than DelayMergeSort,
even on a list of length 1000. Increase the length of the list being
sorted by DelayMergeSort and InsertSort until DelayMergeSort runs
faster than InsertSort. Record the size of a list for which this is
true below. *)
   
let exercise6 = 10000 ;;

(* Big-O also allows us to disregard constant *multiplicative*
factors. In the next exercise, we work with a version of MergeSort
that sorts a given list twice rather than once.  However long
MergeSort takes, DoubleMergeSort will thus take twice as long. *)

module DoubleMergeSort : SORT =
  struct
    (* By sorting the list twice, we double the time MergeSort
       takes *)

faster than InsertSort. *)
   
let exercise7 = 1000 ;;

(* An additional nice property of big-O is the ability to disregard
lower-order terms of a function. In the reading, we found that:

    Time_mergesort(n) = c * n log n + d

add an additional k * n term to the completion time of MergeSort. *)

let exercise9d () : complexity list =

(* Note: This is a bit tricky. Because we are multiplying 30x^2 and
   log(x), we can't simply disregard the log(x), as we could do if
   adding it. 30x^2 * log(x) will not be quadratic, as the log(x) will
   grow faster than any constant we multiply x^2 by. However, log(x)
   grows slower than x, so we know x^2 * log(x) will grow more slowly
   than x^2 * x, so f must grow more slowly than x^3, making this
   function O(x^3) and O(2^x) *)

Part 3: Recurrence Equations

Once we know the complexity of a function, we can use big-O notation
to compare that function's asymptotic performance with other
functions. However, a function's complexity may not be immediately
obvious. Recurrence equations provide an analytical way to determine
the complexity of a function.

Recurrence equations generally consider two cases:

1. A base case
2. A recursive case

Once you have formulated the recursive case, you can use the method of
"unfolding" described in the reading to determine the time complexity
of the functions.

In each of the exercises below, we present a function in OCaml. Your
task is to define the recurrence equations for that function, and then
to solve the recurrence equations via unfolding, to generate a
closed-form equation and form a conclusion about the time complexity
of the function in big-O notation.

To facilitate automated testing of the recurrence equations you come
up with, we ask you to present them in the form of an OCaml
function. (We provide an example below.)  We encourage you to first
complete the problem on paper, with the notation from the chapter and
using the unfolding method, and then transfer your solutions
here. When finding the time complexity, we would like you to use the
tightest possible big-O class.

Many of the recurrences have various constants. We have defined a
global variable, `k`, for you to use for *all* of the constants in your
OCaml formulation of the recurrence equations. Again, the example
below should clarify. *)

let k = 5;;

(* An example of the method we would like you to use for presenting
your recurrence equations and complexity is provided below, based on
the `insert` function from the reading. *)

(*....................................................................
                        RECURRENCE EXAMPLE
....................................................................*)
let rec insert xs x =
    match xs with
    | [] -> [x]
    | h :: t -> if x > h then h :: (insert t x)
                  else x :: xs ;;
(*....................................................................
Complete the recurrence equations and time complexity of this
function:
....................................................................*)

(*
let time_insert (n : int) : int =
    failwith "time_insert not yet implemented" ;;

let insert_complexity () : complexity =
    failwith "insert_complexity not yet implemented" ;;
*)

(*....................................................................
                            SOLUTION

We saw in the reading that the `insert` function has the following
recurrence equations:

T_insert(0) = c
T_insert(n) = max(k_1 + T_insert(n-1), k_2) ≤ k_1 + T_insert(n-1) + k_2
            = k + T_insert(n-1)

We express these equations with the following Ocaml function. Rather
than write two equations, as you might on paper, we write the base
case and recursive case as branches of an if/then/else
expression. Although the recurrence equations have two constants (c
and k), we use the single OCaml variable `k` to play both of those
roles.  Please follow that format in all of the following exercises.
....................................................................*)
  
let rec time_insert (n : int) : int =
  if n = 0 then k
  else k + time_insert (n - 1) ;;

(* (Note that this function will run forever on inputs below 0. We
would normally expect you to handle invalid inputs. However, for the
purpose of practicing recurrence equations, you may assume inputs will
always be positive or nonnegative as the equations require.)

For the time complexity, we use a value from the complexity type to
express the tightest big-O bound for this linear function. *)

let insert_complexity () : complexity =
  Linear ;;

(* Now it's time for you to construct and solve some recurrence
equations, and add them to the lab using the method above.

                            END OF EXAMPLE

Exercise 10: Sum recurrence equations

(* Describe the time complexity recurrence equations for `sum` as an

let rec time_sum (n : int) : int =
  if n = 0 then k
  else k + time_sum (n - 1) ;;

(* What is its complexity? *) 
let sum_complexity () : complexity =
  Linear ;;
  
(*....................................................................
Exercise 11: Divider Recurrence Equations

Formulate the recurrence equations and determine the time complexity
of `divider`, defined below, in terms of the value of its argument
`x`.
....................................................................*)

let rec divider (x : int) : int =
  if x < 0 then
    raise (Invalid_argument "only positive numbers accepted")
  else if x <= 1 then 0
  else 1 + divider (x / 2) ;;
  
let rec time_divider (n : int) : int =
  if n = 0 || n = 1 then k
  else k + time_divider (n / 2) ;;

(* Note: Initially it may seem that `divider`'s input "size" can never
   change: The input is an int, and only ever one int. However,
   divider will repeat a given number of times depending on the value
   of the argument. Thus the size of the input in divider is actually
   the value of the integer input, rather than the length of a list
   input as we had previously seen.
   
   We complete the unfolding process as below:
     T_div(n) = k + T_div(n / 2)
              = k + k + T_div(n / 4)
              = k + k + K + T_div(n / 8)
              = k + k + k + ... + T_div(1)
              = k + k + k + ... + q

   How many k's will we have in the end?  We will have as many k's as
   times that we divide n by 2 before hitting 1 (or 0). This is
   approximately log base 2 of n.

     Thus, T_div(n) = k*log(n) + q
                    = O(log(n))

(* Split considers 2 elements at a time, thus we subtract 2 in the
   recursive case. We can unfold as below:

   T_split(0) = T_split(1) = q
   T_split(n) = k + T_split(n - 2)
              = k + k + T_split(n - 4)
              = k + k + ... + T(0)
              = k + k + .... + q

   How many k's will we have? Not exactly n, as we subtracted
   2 each unfold. Instead, we will have n/2. Our closed
   form solution is thus:

   T_split(n) = k * (n / 2) + q

   However, with regards to big-O, this division by two can be
   disregarded, and we have that T_split is O(n).  *)

(* When unfolding `find_min`, you may have recognized the "Divide and
   Conquer" pattern discussed in the reading.  You also had to know
   the time complexity of `split` to determine the time complexity of
   `find_min`. Often, it can be useful to consider each helper
   function's complexity separately. You can then use the derived
   closed form solutions when calculating the time complexity of the
   larger function.

   T_fm(0) = T_fm(1) = c
   T_fm(n) = k + T_split(n) + 2T_fm(n/2)    <-   We can immediately substitute our
   T_fm(n) = k + k * (n / 2) + q + 2T_fm(n/2)    closed form solution for T_split
   T_fm(n) = k + k * (n / 2) + q + k + 2T_split(n/2) + 4T_fm(n/4)
   T_fm(n) = k + k * (n / 2) + q + k + 2k * (n / 4) + 2q + 4T_fm(n/4)
   T_fm(n) = k + k * (n / 2) + q + k + k * (n / 2) + 2q + 4T_fm(n/4)
   ....

   We will end up unfolding log(n) times total. Each time we unfold we
   add a constant related to the time to match and call functions, and
   terms relating to the splitting time. In total, our constant k
   will be summed log(n) times, giving us a k * log(n) term in our
   closed form solution.

   Splitting adds two terms each time, one that is constant (q), and one
   that is linear in the size of the list being split (k * n / 2). The linear
   term stays a consistent k * n / 2. Though we make more splits, the
   size of the list halves, and these forces cancel each other
   out. (Ignoring for a moment the constant in the split closed
   form solution, 2T_split(n/2) becomes 2(k * n / 4) = k * n / 2). As
   we unfold log(n) times, adding a k * n / 2 term each time, we will
   have a term of log(n) * k * n / 2 = k * nlog(n) / 2 in our closed
   form.

   We can now return to the constant in the closed form solution of
   T_split.  How does this constant affect the closed form
   solution. Let's look only at what happens to this constant in each
   unfold:

   T_fm(n) = k + k * (n / 2) + q + k + k * (n / 2) + 2q + 4T_fm(n/4)
   T_fm(n) = ..... + q + .... + 2q + 4T_fm(n/4)
   T_fm(n) = ..... + q + .... + 2q + .... + 4q + 8T_fm(n/8)

   Each time we unfold, we double the number of q's we add.
   Thus, at the k'th unfold, we add 2^k * q to our equation.
   In the base case, we are at the log(n)th unfold. Though we have
   been vague thus far, we assume a log base 2 for simplicity of
   computation. Thus at the k'th unfold we add 2^(log(n)) * q.
   This simplifies to n * q. As each term added is double the
   term before, the total amount of steps added from this
   component is less than 2 * n * q. Thus, this constant adds a linear
   term to our closed form solution.

   The last component of our closed form solution is the constant, c,
   that encompassess the time the two base cases take.

   Gathering all our terms, we have:
   T_fm(n) = k * log(n) + (k / 2) * nlog(n) + 2 * q * n + c

   To find the closest big O class, we need only look at the largest
   term. This term is (k / 2) * n log(n). We can drop constant factors,
   finding that `find_min` is O(n log(n))

(* 3. The Karatsuba algorithm is a multiplication algorithm that
utilizes a divide-and-conquer approach. It was divised in 1960 by
23-year-old student Anatoly Karatsuba after his Professor Andrey
Kolmogorov conjectured that the fastest possible multiplication
algorithm would be lower bounded (that is, no faster than) O(n^2).
Karatsuba's algorithm disproved that conjecture. To multiply two
n-digit numbers, Karatsuba's algorithm runs in O(n^(log_2 3)), that
is, n to the power of log base 2 of 3, which is about n^1.4.
